  Items
    Core
      Trinity Force
        Irelia is able to trigger Sheen often, mainly with her ultimate. Her Q procs on hit effects so it works well with Sheen and Phage. She benefits from every stat on Trinity Force.
    Offense
      Hexdrinker
        Scales with Q and R. Works well against burst/lots of AP
      Sterak’s Gage
        Great 2nd item especially for team-fighting. Helps your Q execute minions later into the game. Good against squishies.
      Blade of the Ruined King
        Split push item. Good vs Tanks. Great 1 vs 1 power.
    Armor
      Ninja Tabi
        Good when they don’t have a lot of CC or the CC can be dodged easily. Great rush in lane against physical poke.
      Thornmail
        Great for when you’re stacking armor. Buy vs multiple auto attackers or their ADC is their only threat. 4th or 5th item usually.
      Frozen Heart
        Good follow up item to a health item. 
      Randuin’s Omen
        Good as a follow up to Trinity, Health + Resistance Items make you the tankiest in the mid game
      Deadman’s Plate
        TODO test
    Magic Resistance
      Mercury Treads
        Good vs numerous(how many?) CCs or a reliable hard CC that will frequently be targeted at you
      Guardian Angel
        Great late game item, 4th item usually, allows you to dive the backline much easier
      Spirit Visage
        Good as a follow up to Trinity, Health + Resistance Items make you the tankiest in the mid game
