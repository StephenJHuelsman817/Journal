Irelia
  Runes
    Standard
      Quints: 3 Attack Speed
        Scale well with her W which is her main source of damage and is frequently maxed first, scales well with Rageblade and BOTRK, helps last hit
      Reds: 9 Attack Damage
        Scales well with her Q and R, scales well with Trinity and Ghostblade, good vs fragile opponents helps last hit
      Yellows: 9 Scaling Armor Yellows
        Scales well with her W, generally plays a passively in lane before level 4
      Blues: 9 Scaling Magic Resistance
        Scales well with her W, most early magic damage can be mitigated by sustain or dodging their abilities
    Vs Tanks
      Quints: 3 Attack Speed
      Reds: 9 Attack Speed
        Extra attack speed is used against more durable opponents, more attack speed leads to more hits from W which makes longer fights more favorable
      Yellows: 9 Scaling Armor Yellows
      Blues: 9 Scaling Magic Resistance
    Vs AD
      Quints: 1 Attack Speed, 2 Armor
        Extra armor is used here against lane opponents who bully early

  Masteries
    Setup 1
      21/9/0
      With these masteries and Trinity Force Irelia can kill almost all carries 1v1. She is normally not the primary engage. Her role is to do damage.
  Builds
    Core
      Trinity Force
        Irelia is able to trigger Sheen often, mainly with her ultimate. Her Q procs on hit effects so it works well with Sheen and Phage. She benefits from every stat on Trinity Force.
  Offense
    Hexdrinker
      Scales with Q and R. Works well against burst/lots of AP
    Sterak’s Gage
      Great 2nd item especially for team-fighting. Helps your Q execute minions later into the game. Good against squishies.
    Blade of the Ruined King
      Split push item. Good vs Tanks. Great 1 vs 1 power.
  Armor
    Ninja Tabi
      Good when they don’t have a lot of CC or the CC can be dodged easily. Great rush in lane against physical poke.
    Thornmail
      Great for when you’re stacking armor. Buy vs multiple auto attackers or their ADC is their only threat. 4th or 5th item usually.
    Frozen Heart
      Good follow up item to a health item.

    Deadman’s Plate
