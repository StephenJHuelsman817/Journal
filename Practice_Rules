League of Legends Practice Rules
  Practice Goals
    Self-Improvement
    Climbing the Ladder
  Warmups
  Ranked Games Session – 3 Games
    Try to play a different champion in each game
    Before the game starts figure out what SMART Goal you will attempt
    Don’t pick a champion into a bad matchup just because you played all your other champions
    Wait 5 minutes to re-queue in between each game
    Stop playing if you have 2 very poor games in a row to avoid tilt
    Stop playing if your wrist is hurting and go take the necessary steps to heal
  Picks and Bans
    If there is a priority champion you want to play ask to trade for it
    If there is a priority champion that you cannot play ask to ban it
    Scaling champions do well against Passive Champions
      Ex. Vlad vs Maokai
    Aggressive champions do well against Scaling champions
      Ex. Renekton vs Jax
    Safe champions do well against Aggressive Champions
      Ex. Irelia vs Renekton
  Normal Games
    Try out things that are not certain to work, that is how you improve
    Ganking Mid
    Ganking bot through lane as opposed to teleport
    Figuring out who can solo dragon and when
    Invading the enemy jungle
    Who can do jungle camps at level 1
  Concepts to think about while playing
    How to play the lane at the different stages
    What are the core items the champion needs to do their job?
    Can you reasonably build for the lane?
    What is the champion’s role in team fights?
    How do you carry with this champion?
    How do you affect the map with this champion?
  Climbing the Ladder
  Do things that we know will work, our primary goal is to climb
  Tier 1 Top Laners – Irelia, Lissandra, Sion, Riven
  Tier 1 Junglers – Vi, 
  **During Practice
  Do a warmup before playing ranked
    Practice farming with a champion you plan to play that day
    Practice a not yet mastered champion in a normal game
  In champion select
    Provide champions that are difficult to deal with so they can be banned
    Attempt to secure priority picks
    Pick a champion that fits into the team composition
    Provide insight as to what would work well with the team composition
    Begin analyzing how both teams win the game
      What are both teams’ strategies
      Who are the win conditions
      Where does each team want to fight, open area(lane) or corridors(jungle)
      How does each team fight
        Who engages/what is their engage
        Which team should spread out/stay together
        5v5 or 1-3-1 or 1-4
    If time permits begin typing out thoughts to the rest of the team
    Do all this while taking in their inputs and fostering collaboration
  In Game
    Present to the team your thoughts on what needs to happen in order to achieve victory at the beginning of the game and again a little bit before it happens
