Friends’ Advice

o	The1337Troll: “You ever feel like you hit a wall in this game?”
o	54Bomb99: “Yah, of course”
o	The1337Troll: “Well that’s where I'm at now. I’m trying to figure out how to get past it, any tips?”
o	54Bomb99: “Well for me it comes to a point of what you are trying to do with league.”
o	“Are you climbing for the sake of self-improvement, climbing to reach challenger, climbing for fun, or climbing for a higher purpose like going pro.”
o	“Define which one you are doing it for and see how much effort is required. If you can’t put in that effort you are forced to reevaluate why you want to play.”
o	“But if you are looking to actually get past the wall, try thinking about what your style is and how you can use it to effect the map more. Winning your own lane isn’t as important as applying pressure to the whole map. Having a CS lead doesn’t mean anything if it doesn’t get translated into map wide pressure, so think more in terms of how to apply more pressure when you play”

o	The1337Troll: “It's a lot to think about and I'm going to go digest it before playing again.”
o	54Bomb99: “Yup smart move”
