Malphite
  Runes
    Standard
      Quints: 3 Armor
        Scales well with his Passive, W and E
        Helps survive lane phase
      Reds: 9 Attack Speed
        Scales well with his W
        Helps last hit
        Helps with farming jungle camps
      Yellows: 9 Scaling Health
        Scales well with his Passive and W
        Builds more armor items than health items
        Scaling > Flat because it is unlikely you get a solo kill or get solo killed before lvl 6
        He does not need to get the push advantage in order to farm effectively
        His time to shine is in teamfights rather than in lane and scaling helps him more in that phase of the game
      Blues: 9 Scaling Magic Resistance
        Scales well with his Passive
        Useful against Hybrids in lane
        He doesn't want to build many MR items because the armor items scale better
        Most early poke from APs come from autos rather than abilities
        Early magic damage can be mitigated with his Passive
    Vs All AD
      Quints: 2 Armor, 1 Scaling Cooldown Reduction
        1 CDR Quint to get to 20%
      Reds: 9 Attack Speed
      Yellows: 9 Scaling Health
      Blues: 9 Scaling Cooldown Reduction
        MR isn't needed in this scenario
        Scaling CDR > Flat CDR because it is unlikely to generate a kill pre 6
        Lowers Ult CD which is his main form of playmaking
    Vs AP in Lane
      Quints: 3 Ability Power
        AP Quints are used because you max Q in this situation
        Q has the highest AP ratio of his abilities
        Helps him stick to ranged champions
      Reds: 9 Magic Penetration
        Scales well with Q
        Also scales fine with E and R but they aren't the reason they are taken
        Last hitting becomes worse
      Yellows: 9 Scaling Health
      Blues: 9 Scaling Magic Resistance
  Masteries
    Standard
      12/0/18
      Ferocity
        Fury/Sorcery
        Feast for lane sustain
        Vampirism for lane sustain
        Oppressor because it works off his Q and E
      Cunning
      Resolve
        Unyielding because he scales well with resistances and has a lot of them
        Tough Skin for trading and jungle farming
        Insight for added playmaking ability
        Legendary Guardian as default for above reasons, Swiftness against teams with a lot of CC/Slows
        Grasp of the Undying for trading, lasting longer in teamfights and killing ADCs
