	Training Perfect Play and Avoiding Poor Play
•	Laning
o	If melee vs a ranged get to lane early to pull the creeps closer to the bush
o	Ward the area you don’t expect the jungler to come from
o	Try to ward before 3:10 and without losing minions
o	Try to predict which lanes will be camped and which lanes will be ignored
o	Tank before proxy farming
	Do I out scale?
	Will I die in a 1v2?
	Will my team get anything out of my proxy?
o	Try roaming mid/bot for dragon if you’re ahead and they are behind
o	Utilize your jungler for tower dives, jungle invades and dragon control
•	Take timers
o	Ultimate
o	Buffs
o	Dragon
o	Baron
•	Don’t let bad decisions throw your games whether they be yours or someone else’s i.e. don’t tilt
•	Don’t think that someone else’s opinion is better than your own
	Blue side
•	If pushing Ward these places, ward farther down the more susceptible you are to ganks
o	Enemy Tri
o	River
o	Wraiths
o	Golems
o	Champions: Renekton, Shyvana, Ryze, Elise
•	Ward Tri and/or Entry to Blue Buff if pushed and low
