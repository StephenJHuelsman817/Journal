        Helps him escape from ganks
      Reds: 9 Magic Penetration
        Scales with all of his abilities
        TODO consider something else

        Scales with his Passive, W and E
        Scales with resistance items such as Abyssal or Hourglass
      Blues: 9 Scaling Ability Power

        Flat AP wouldn't help get a kill in lane

    Setup 1
      0/18/12
        Take Stormraider's Surge for the same reasons you take movement speed quints
          E + Q + Auto combo can trigger it early game
          His AoE triggers it later in the game
        Take Insight to make laning easier and to make more TP plays
  Items
    Offense
      Boots of Swiftness
        Most frequent boot choice for the same reasons you take MS quints
      Luden's Echo
        Gives MS, see MS quints,
        Time the trigger with your ultimate
        Scales better with AP + CDR than with Magic Penetration
        Ratio's on the heal from Q and R put AP + CDR over the top
      Rabadon's Deathcap
        Try buying this 5th if you're really fed
    Health
      Warmog's Armor
        The passive is great for sieging/splitting
        Also has CDR which scales great with Vlad
        Good item when you don't have much of a front line
      Liandry's Torment
        Great item vs enemy front line
      Rylai's Crystal Scepter
        Core item on Vlad
        Slow allows him to keep enemies in range of his abilities
        Scales well with his passive because it has both AP and Health
    Armor
      Ninja Tabi
        Try this out vs heavy auto attack based teams
      Thornmail
        Try this out when you're the frontliner against auto attack based teams
      Zhonya's Hourglass
        Active helps him teamfight
        Try to E+Q combo then W then E + Q again then hourglass then E + Q into W
    Magic Resistance
      Mercury Treads
        Buy vs hard CC teams
        Also good vs heavy magic damage teams
      Abyssal Scepter
        Magic item when you want more offense
        Goes well with another magic damage team member
      Spirit Visage
        Magic item when you want to survive in fights longer
